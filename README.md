# Dantcho - Personal Website Landing Page

I wanted to create cool landing page for my website with a lot of animations and cool stuff, but I decided to leave it for later and focus on the main functionality of the website.

## Used:

* [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js) - For the background particles
